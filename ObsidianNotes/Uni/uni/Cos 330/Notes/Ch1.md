# Security challenges
- Consider potential attacks when designing secure systems
- Counter intuitive procedures can make securing services hard
- Physical and Logical placement of security services need to be determined
- Secret information often required, creation, distribution and protection of secret information becomes important
- Attackers only need to find one weakness
- Security is often an afterthought in most systems
- Regular and constant monitoring
- Tendency to percieve little value untill a failure happens 
- Strong security == less user friend;y is viewed by many people
