## Shaders and rendering 
Use shaders to process vertices
- need at least one 
	- vertex shader to process primitive vertices
	- one fragment shader to process rasterized fragment

**Vertex Shader**
- determine how vertices are to be transformed and prepared before use in fragment shader
![[Pasted image 20250318142319.png]]
- Passes incoming vertex position (in_Position) out as gl_Position
