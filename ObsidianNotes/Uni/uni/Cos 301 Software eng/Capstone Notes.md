# Tech stack
Here’s a **recommended tech stack**, tailored to match:

- security testing
    
- web API interaction
    
- automation
    
- scalability
    
- your COS 301 Capstone expectations
    

---

### 1. **Backend/Scanning Engine**

> This is the core that runs scans, sends API requests, analyzes responses.

**Recommended:**

- **Python** (main language)
    
    - Very mature for HTTP requests, automation, security tooling
        
    - Huge libraries for web, networking, parsing
        
- Key libraries:
    
    - `requests` (for sending API requests)
        
    - [`urllib3`](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/) (lower-level control if needed)
        
    - `BeautifulSoup` or [`lxml`](https://lxml.de/) (for parsing responses if needed)
        
    - [`jsonschema`](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/) (for validating API responses against schemas)
        
    - [`sqlmap`](https://sqlmap.org/) integration (optional for SQLi testing automation)
        
    - [`JWT`](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/) (for dealing with JSON Web Tokens)
        

---

### 2. **Web Interface (Dashboard)**

> If you want users to upload API definitions (e.g., OpenAPI), launch scans, and see results.

**Recommended:**

- **Flask** (lightweight) **or** **FastAPI** (even faster, async-based)
    
- **React.js** for frontend (optional, if you want something more polished)
    
- Or just use **basic Flask templates** (Jinja2) if you want to keep it simple
    

---

### 3. **Database**

> Store scan results, user info, vulnerability reports.

**Recommended:**

- **PostgreSQL** (robust, open-source, production-ready)
    
- **SQLAlchemy** (Python ORM) if you use Flask/FastAPI
    
- OR a light **NoSQL database** like **MongoDB** if you prefer JSON document storage (easier for flexible reports)
    

---

### 4. **Authentication / Access Control**

> (RBAC system, user login, etc.)

**Recommended:**

- Use **Flask-Login** or **FastAPI Authentication** modules
    
- JWT-based tokens for sessions if you need an API for your frontend
    

---

### 5. **Security and Deployment**

> Secure and scalable.

**Recommended:**

- **Docker** (containerize your tool — backend + frontend + DB)
    
- **Docker Compose** (easy local setup)
    
- **NGINX** (reverse proxy, optional but useful)
    
- **Let's Encrypt** (free SSL certificates if exposed externally)
    

---

### 6. **Other Helpful Tools**

> For scaling, automation, future extension.

- **Celery + Redis** for async scanning jobs if needed
    
- **Kubernetes** (optional, for future scalability — nice if BITM wants orchestration)
    
- **OpenAPI Spec Parser** (e.g., [`openapi-spec-validator`](https://pypi.org/project/openapi-spec-validator/)) to validate uploaded API specifications
