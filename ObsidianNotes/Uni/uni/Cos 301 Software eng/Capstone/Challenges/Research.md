Stuff we need to research

Priority 1 (before demo 1)
- Types of API Architecture.
- How do other API scanners work.
- Types of API Vulnerabilities (Focus on OWASP API top 10).
- Potential impact of API Vulnerabilities on different types of businesses.
- Compliance Checks relevant to South Africa (ask Ivan for help with this).
- How to use the MITRE api to get information about vulnerabilities.
- Best way to integrate the API scanner into an already existing project.
- What would someone expect in the final report
	- Could have a technical report for devs and a Executive report for stakeholders?


Priority 2 (after demo 1)
- How to test for Authentication and Authorisation flaws 
- How to make the API scanner context aware.
	- for example:
		- In a bidding marketplace viewing the previous purchases of another user can be fine.
		- For a pharmaceutical market place, viewing the previous purchases of another user would result if fines or a law suit.
- Common endpoints and URI patterns for different types of businesses 
- How does rate limiting work and how to test if it's been implemented properly
- Detailed testing methods for each OWASP api top 10
- What South African laws should the API be adhering to (POPIA, more?)
