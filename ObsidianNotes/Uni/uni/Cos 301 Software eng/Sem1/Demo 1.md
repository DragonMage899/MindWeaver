## **Project Intro** 1min
- Team: MP5
- Background
	- MPDB was built with the goal enabling users to easily share and collaborate on scalable and flexible databases without compromising on performance.
- Scope
	- Allows users to efficiently manage unstructured data by providing flexible solutions to database management.
	- Handy premade templates allow users get straight to work without having to worry about tedious set up.
	- User friendly Web UI and easy to use JS library and rest api allows anyone to easily integrate mpdb into their workflow
	- Components
		- Daemon serving as the database engine
		- Command-Line Interface for direct database operations
		- REST API for application integration
		- JavaScript client library for developers
		- Web UI for visual database management and access to public resources


## **Documentation** (STUFF IN REPO) 2min

Random Ideas I had
- Selling point: Ability to easily share you database templates and access to your database
- Allow users to charge for access to their database\
- open source
- CIA triad for data sec
- Docker cloud deployment

**Possible questions**
- Agile
1. **User-Centric Development:**  
    _"Our Agile approach allows us to prioritize user feedback, ensuring MPDB evolves to meet real-world needs effectively."_
    
2. **Continuous Improvement:**  
    _"With frequent iterations and testing, we refine MPDB’s performance, scalability, and usability at every stage."_
    
3. **Collaboration & Efficiency:**  
    _"Agile fosters strong teamwork and adaptability, enabling us to deliver high-quality features on time."_
    
4. **Scalability & Flexibility:**  
    _"Agile development ensures MPDB remains scalable and adaptable to changing database needs and technologies."_
