Overview

# The application of engineering principles to software development.
Key Areas:
➢Requirements gathering
➢Software design and modeling
➢Quality assurance and testing

## Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Software Engineering:
➢Focus on design patterns, system architecture, and
modular development.

## Professionalism: Commitment to high-quality
code, ethical practices, and effective teamwork.
•Tool Support: Essential tools to support every
phase of the software lifecycle.
•Accountability: Legal and ethical responsibility
for the quality and outcomes of software
systems.

# Requirements Gathering

Involves gathering the functional and non-functional
requirements of the system from stakeholders.
Techniques:
➢Interviews
➢Surveys and questionnaires
➢Document analysis
Key Outcomes:
➢ Clear understanding of what the system is expected to
do.
➢ Identification of user needs and system constraints.

# Software Design and Modelling
Software design focuses on creating a blueprint for the
system’s structure and behavior.
Key Aspects:
➢ Architecture design (system components and their
interactions).
➢ Detailed design (class, sequence, and state diagrams).
Tools & Techniques:
➢ UML (Unified Modeling Language)
➢ Design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).
➢ Prototyping and mock-ups.

# QA and testing
Testing:
➢ Unit Testing: Verifies individual components or units.
➢ Integration Testing: Ensures components work together as expected.
➢ System Testing: Validates the overall behavior and functionality of the
system.
➢ User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Ensures the system meets user
expectations.
QA Tools:
➢ Test automation tools (e.g., Selenium, JUnit).
➢ Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

Expectations:
➢Focus on teamwork, communication, and
quality.
➢Prepare for both practical and theoretical
challenges.
