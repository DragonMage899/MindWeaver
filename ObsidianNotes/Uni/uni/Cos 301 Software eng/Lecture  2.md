# Intro to swe

**Software Engineering**
- Application of engineering principles to software development

**Software Characteristics**
- Intangible
- Modifiability 
- Complexity

**SWE lifecycle**
- Planning 
	- Features
	- Resources
	- Time
- Design
	- User interfaces
	- Database Schema
	- Storage
- Implementation
- Testing
- Maintenance

**Waterfall Model**
- Linear sequence of steps
	- Planning, Design, Construction, Maintenance 
		- Once a step is finished you can't go back
- Well defined requirements
- Strict documentation
- Approval at each stage before moving forward

**Agile Methodology**
- Start with releasing initial version then iteratively release features
- SCUM framework
	- Features developed in sprints
	- Regular meetings to adjust based on feedback

**CH2 Unified Process**
- Framework that guides development of software through iterative and incremental cycles
- Integrates best practices from various methodologies including
- Reduce risk and improve software quality and ensure stakeholder satisfaction


- Phases
	- Inception
		- Define: Project Scope, Goals and high level requirements
		- Task: Identify stakeholders, estimate resources and costs, set up timeline 
	- Elaboration
		- Refine Requirements and define system architecture
		- Detailed design of system components (data models, ui, security protocols)
		- Ensure solid architectural foundation is laid before development begins
	- Construction
		- System is built iterating over several development cycles 
		- Code is written, tested and integrated into system
		- Continuous integration and frequent  
	- Transition
		- Moving system into production and delivering it to users
		- Deployment, User training and bug fixing
		- After release product enters maintenance and support mode

- Use Cases
	- Capture functional requirements from user pov
	- Each use case defines how a user interacts with the system to achieve a specific goal
	- Use cases help ensure that the system functionality meets needs of users and stakeholders

- Iterative and Incremental Development 
	- Cyclic development
		- Each cycle produces a working version of the system
	- Feedback from users and stake holders incorporated into each iteration to refine prod
	- Increments: Add functionality
	- Iteration: Improve quality and development 

- Small teams
	- Reduce formality of certain phases
	- Focus on essential practices
	- Full arch, doc and proj management not needed
	- Emphasize communication, shared ownership of tasks and rapid iterations
