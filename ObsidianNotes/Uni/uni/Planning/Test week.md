# COS 333
- Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 15
- Study from both textbook and slides 
- View notes on slides using office/libre
- Learn terminology

**Chapter 1**
- The whole chapter is important, except for the discussion related to Figure 1.2, Section 1.7.4, and Section 1.8. In Section 1.7
- Don't go over detailed steps of compilation and hybrid implementation process
- Apply Language evaluation criteria
- orthogonality will be tested
- go over hypothetical languages

**Chapter 2**
- Leave out Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.6.2, and 2.9.2. For Section 2.20, only focus on what's in the slides. For the remaining sections, don't focus on finer details. 
- For each language know:
	- Environment for development/application
			- (this includes aspects such as the intended users, intended application area, software engineering approaches that were popular at the time of development, and general characteristics of the computer system for which the language was designed).
	- How the environment affected the language 
	- Main contribution of each language
- You don't need to know specific features that were introduced in certain versions of the language, dates, specific model names and model numbers of the computers the languages were designed for, the names of the programming language developers, or details about the design committees.

**Chapter 15**
- Important
- Study all the material up to and including Section 15.5, and Section 15.11
		- (in other words, don't study Common Lisp, ML, Haskell, F#, and support for functional programming in imperative programming languages).
- ignore 15.2 and 15.4
- Note that the slides contain material covered in Sections 7.2.2 (operator eval order), 8.2.2.4 (Multiple Selection Using if, else if), 6.9 (List Types), and 5.5.2 (blocks), which is examinable
- Study slides and book
- The lambda expressions in Section 15.5.4 are also not examinable.
- Write and analyse simple scheme programs
	- the member, equalsimp, equal, and append functions)
- Go over prac2
- DrRacker interpreter to write

**Chapter 3**
: Dijkstra's algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

Please note that this announcement includes a remark or two about the semester test and final examination.

As you are aware, the plan is to spend about one to two weeks per layer.  Two such periods are allocated to layer 7, given our two perspectives on the application layer.  We are busy discussing the DNS in the second of these perspectives (as part of application layer protocols that support the network).  Usually, the DNS discussion takes a bit longer than planned (as is currently the case).  With some luck, we will finalise our discussion of the DNS on Monday, 10 March.

This leaves three layer 7 topics to be discussed: Network management, directory access and routing.  The plan is to finalise all these topics by Wednesday, 12 March.  Next week only has a Wednesday lecture, during which we will move down to layer 6 and discuss representation of characters.  The following week pauses lectures for a test week.

Given that we will only have introduced layer 6 when the test week starts, the semester test will not cover any details of layer 6.  The semester test will cover the introductory work (which includes all seven layers and more).  The semester test will also cover the two perspectives on the application layer in detail.  Practical assignments 1 and 2 may also be revisited in the semester test.

The discussion of layer 7 requires a discussion of two topics that you are very familiar with: Dijkstra's algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm.  The odds are that you will find revisiting these two topics boring.  On the other hand, including one of (or both) these topics in the semester test, is an opportunity to collect some easy marks.  I suggest the following compromise: 1) You study these two topics from the videos provided below (which you can do at double speed), which means you avoid a repetitive lecture and (2) some questions about the topic will be included in the semester test (which are easy marks if you know how to apply these algorithms).  **The examination will then also include a question on this topic.**

The videos are the online lectures about [Diskstra's algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BRp-n8fHEk) and the [Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxaz-Q15_aY) on my Youtube channel at [https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkProf](https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkProf).  Note that the videos talk about the same algorithms that you have encountered before.  However, the depiction of intermediate results may or may not be the same as you have been taught.  Double check that you are able to apply the algorithms using the same manner as shown in the videos.
