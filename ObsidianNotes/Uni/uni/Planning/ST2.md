- Scope:
- Chapter 8
- Chapter 9
- Chapter 12
- Chapter 17
- Chapters 2 and 6 are assumed knowledge.
- You are allowed to bring in any non-electronic notes/textbooks/materials as well as a calculator.

  

The semester test will focus more on theory and its application/reasoning. While a portion of the test will contain mathematics, but it will not be to the same degree as the class tests.

The scope of the first semester test includes Chapters 16, 5, and 6. Below is more detail on the individual chapters:
**General**
  Note that the textbook covers material that the slides do not, and vice versa. Please study from both. Also note that I have included numerous notes for many of the slides, which can be viewed in PowerPoint or LibreOffice.
Also, make sure that you learn the terminology used throughout the textbook, because you must use the correct terms to discuss the programming language concepts. It is important to be as specific as possible when naming programming language features.
**Chapter 16**
This chapter is very important. All material in the chapter is examinable. You need to be able to analyse and write simple Prolog programs no more complex than the examples covered in class (the member, append, and reverse propositions) and the practicals. I VERY STRONGLY recommend that all students complete Practicals 3 and 4, because they provide good practice for the program code implementation questions you can expect.

For questions that require you to write Prolog code, you will have to use the SWI-Prolog interpreter (as described in the Practical 3 specification) under Windows. Therefore, if you implemented your Prolog practical tasks using a different interpreter (such as an online interpreter), make sure you familiarise yourself with the SWI-Prolog interpreter before the test. Also note that the same restrictions on which elements of the Prolog language you are allowed to use, which are laid out in the specifications for Practicals 3 and 4, will also apply to the test questions. You may only use the language features described in the textbook and the additional hints provided in the practical specifications.

There are several additional examples of Prolog implementation questions, which can be used as extra exercises, in the example test and examination papers.
**Chapter 5**
The whole chapter is examinable.
**Chapter 6**
- Leave out sections 6.3.5, 6.5.9, 6.6.2, 6.7.4, 6.10.5, and 6.11.7 (all these sections deal with implementation issues that fall under the domain of compiler construction).
- Sections 6.4, 6.5.4, 6.12, and 6.16 is also not examinable.
- Pay attention to discriminated unions (a graphical example is provided in the slides, but the textbook discusses the same concept using F#).
