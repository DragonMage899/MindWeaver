High school
- Bad habits
	- Studied day before
	- Most of the teachers were good, a lot of kids from under priv backgrounds, the focus was more on getting people to pass
	- Usually had a a lot free time during class
	- used this to work ahead (mostly activities)
	- okay with missing a few days (1/3 absent in grade 12)
	- When it came time to study, usually okay studying the day before for most subjects 
	- Lead to a lot of procrastinating 

Uni
First year
- not really much time to study ahead
- Still has a habit of skipping days and leaving things to the last
- But I still doing okay, didn't feel at risk of failing anything but my marks weren't great
- Exams roll around, mostly day before
- Module was worried about was wtw114, calc
- Because of the day before shenanigans didn't really have a good foundation.
- Put some effort than I was used to into studying, still ended up failing it, Supp was bad
- Spent the mid year break sulking, put me into a weird mental state
	- Put in extra effort but it didn't work 
- sem 2 went bad
- Not really doing my projects, skipping most days
- physics sem test mark was okay, I skipped a lot practicals was denied exam entrance
- Mind was geared towards dropping out 
- failed most of the stuff except for aim passed 2/7

Bit of a wake up call
- Main issues was procrastination and not starting the work
- Procrastination steps
	- Leech block, phone away
- Not starting
	- Time management. 

Redid second semester
- A little rocky at the start but improvement did come
- Slowly got my mind back on track, I felt like I could complete the degree

Second Year
- By the end of last year I had a nice routine down for making sure I got my assignments done, still starting the day before for the sem tests, I made sure that each hour of the day was planned which helped alot 
- Passed everything with a few distinctions
- Okay spot but still not doing as well as I would like 

Third Year
- 2 Goals, lecture, marks 
- Attend more lectures
	- Going well untill recess, only missed 3 days
	- After recess we had a lot of assignments due
- Improve my marks 
	- Obvious way to do this would be to start studying earlier 

Add in
- Can't get through learning books in general
- Problem since my career field requires me to devour content
- Read a lot of fantasy book, maybe?
