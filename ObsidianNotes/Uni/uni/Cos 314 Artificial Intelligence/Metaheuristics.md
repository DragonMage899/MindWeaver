# Swarm Intelligence

- Examine collective behaviour of social animals to develop algorithms to solve complex problems

## Swarm
- Group of agents that interact with one another and their environment
- Adhere to a simple rule to achieve intricate goals

# Ant Colony Optimisation 
Swarm intelligence algorithm

Pheromones:
The more a trail is travelled, the stronger the pheromones will be, thus shorter paths will have more travels over a long time interval making more attractive.
Pheromones on weak paths will eventually evaporate.
ACO mimics this by guiding a group of artificial ants to find the optimal solutions to complex problems through the use of pheromone trails.
