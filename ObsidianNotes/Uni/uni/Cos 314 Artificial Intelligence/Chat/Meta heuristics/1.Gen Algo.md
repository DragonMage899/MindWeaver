## üß¨ Genetic Algorithms (GA)

### üå± Core Idea

Mimics biological evolution. Uses a **population of candidate solutions** (chromosomes) that evolve over time using **selection**, **crossover**, and **mutation** to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.

### üîÅ Algorithm Workflow

1. **Initialize** a random population of solutions.
    
2. **Evaluate** the fitness of each individual.
    
3. **Select** individuals to be parents based on fitness.
    
4. **Apply Crossover** to produce offspring.
    
5. **Apply Mutation** to introduce variation.
    
6. **Replace** some or all of the old population with new individuals.
    
7. Repeat from step 2 until stopping criteria are met (e.g., generation limit or convergence).
    

### üõ† When to Use

- Discrete or combinatorial problems (e.g., timetabling, traveling salesman).
    
- No gradient or derivative available.
    
- Large search space or many local optima.
    

### ‚ú® Key Components

- **Chromosome Representation**: Binary strings, permutations, or real numbers depending on problem.
    
- **Fitness Function**: Custom function that evaluates how good a solution is (can be multi-objective).
    
- **Selection**:
    
    - _Roulette Wheel_: Probability proportional to fitness.
        
    - _Tournament_: Random subsets compete.
        
- **Crossover Methods**:
    
    - _Single-Point_: Swap after a point.
        
    - _Two-Point_: Swap between two points.
        
    - _Uniform_: Randomly pick genes from each parent.
        
- **Mutation**:
    
    - _Bit Flip_ for binary.
        
    - _Swap or Inversion_ for permutations.
        
    - _Gaussian Noise_ for real values.
        

### üß† Tips for Application

- Tune mutation/crossover rates carefully (e.g., 0.6‚Äì0.9 crossover, 0.01‚Äì0.1 mutation).
    
- Use elitism to preserve the best solutions.
    
- Representations and operators must respect the constraints of the problem.
