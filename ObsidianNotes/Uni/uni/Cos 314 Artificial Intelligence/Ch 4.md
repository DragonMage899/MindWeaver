# Combinatorial Problems
- Mathematical puzzles that focus on counting, arranging or choosing items in a specific way
- Problems deal with a limited amount of items
- Typical goals:
	- How many different arrangements / selections are possible given certain rules or restrictions
- Permutation: Number of ways to arrange a set of objects
- Combinations: Number of  ways to pick a smaller group from a larger group
- Partitioning: Number of ways to divide items amongst people
- Graph Coloring: Number of ways to color a map
- Graph Traversal: Number of routers it's possible to take through a network
- tldr: Finding the best way to order, group or assign a limited set of items while meeting criteria

**Combinatorial optimization problems**
- Goal: Find optimal solution that minimizes or maximizes an objective function
	- e.g.) Total cost, distance, time, profit etc.
- Solution spaces can be huge such that exhaustive methods become non-practical 
- Creates a need for specialized algorithms and techniques to search the solution space 
	- e.g.) heuristics, metaheuristics, dynamic programming to
	- can produce near-optimal solutions
