# Intro

Artificial Intelligence is the field of training computers to perform manual labor we don't want to do but otherwise can't implement with robotics or simple algorithms.

This can be done by replicating human intelligence

Turing Test 
- meow

Chinese room
- non Chinese speaker in a room with documents that contain instructions and correlations 
- Chinese note is passed in
- person must use provided materials to craft a Chinese response

#### Search
- Search a state space of possible solutions to solve a problem
- e.g.) depth first, breadth first, heuristic searches

#### Knowledge representation 
- Methods of representing knowledge that the computer needs to think intelligently and solve problems
- e.g.) semantic networks, predicate logic etc.

### Programming languages
- Prolog and Lisp were developed as languages at the time were deemed inappropriate 

#### Prolog
- Declarative programming paradigm 
- Based on mathematical formalisms (first order predicate logic)

#### Lisp
- List Processing
- Functional Programming paradigm 
- Basis -> Recursive function theory

Nowadays C, C++, Java, Python, small talk etc. can be used

# State Space Representation and Search

AI problems must first be represented as a state space.
The state space is then searched to determine a solution to the problem .

#### State Space
- Set of nodes representing each state of the problem
- Transitions represented by arcs between nodes
- Initial and Goal state
- State spaces manifest into a tree or a graph 
- Selection of search technique is dependent on a contingent of factors such as nature of problem and potential representation

**Search techniques in course**:

### Classic Problems
#### Travelling salesman
- Sales must visit each city exactly once
- Find the shortest trip that starts at x and ends at y

#### Tower of Hanoi
- meow

#### 8-Puzzle
- Tiles on a board with a black space
- tiles can transition into spaces
- Goal is to get a specific configuration


### Problem Representation
**Tower of Hanoi**
- Graph

- Transitions abide by the rules of the game


**Eight-Puzzle**
- Legal Move : Moving the Space
- Space can be moved up down left right
Graph:

#### General
- State Space: Set of descriptions or states
- Search Problem:
	- Initial state/s
	- set of legal actions (action is operator/move on a state)
	- Goal state/s
- Operator count is problem dependent and specific to a particular representation 
	- More operator = More Branching Factor (i.e. keep it min)
- Runtime vs Advance 
	- only solve specific config 
- Search algorithms are applied to find a solution path


## Graphs vs Trees
If states in a solution space can be revisited more than once, a directed graph is used to represent the solution state 

**Graph**
- Multiple sequences from node x to node y
- Moves can be undone
- More than one path to the goal
	- Path is more distinguished in a tree
	- Goal's may have to appear more than once in a tree
- Search algo's must consider possible loops and cycles
	- Tree's may be more efficient as no loops or cycles
- Entire tree's / graph's aren't generated


Rules:

## Searching
- admissible iff shortest path is guaranteed

**Tree**
- connected acyclic undirected graph
Often only part of the search space is generated, more get's generated as searching progresses

### Depth First Search
- When jumping, skip over visited
- assume layer by layer generation in this case

![[Pasted image 20250220112224.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250220112233.png]]
- C to E is legal since A and B were visited

### Depth First - Iterative Deepening 
- Perform DFS on several different iteration with different depth bounds or cutoffs
- For each iteration increase cutoff
- terminate when found
- useful for infinite depth
- guaranteed shortest path

### Breadth first search
- Left to right visiting 
![[Pasted image 20250220113809.png]]
### DFS VS BFS
- DFS may get lost or find non optimal path
- DFS more efficient for high branching
- BFS finds shortest path but suffers from combinatorial explosion with high branching (as we add more levels the search time increases exponentially)

# Heuristic Search
If we want to reduce the size of the search space (which can be memory cumbersome with DFS and BFS) we cab use a heuristic search instead by applying an evaluation function to each goal to assess how promising it is in leading to the goal

**Heuristic searches**
- Best First Search
- A* algorithm
- Hill Climbing 
Use some domain specific knowledge to choose next node to search.
- Weak search methods : using heuristics to determine next node

## Calculating Heuristics
Heuristics may find a solution but it's not guaranteed.
Heuristic functions: Estimate cost from a node to the goal node.

Using heuristics while searching should hopefully speed up the search process but heuristic functions aren't always accurate (if they were there would be no need for a search process)

**Heuristic value**: approximate cost of finding solution
Heuristic value >= 0 for all nodes.
If HV == 0
	Goal state 

**Admissible Heuristic**: Never over estimates cost of a node
- not all heuristics are admissible

if HV == infinity
	Dead end (doesn't lead anywhere)

Good Heuristics are not computationally expensive.

Heuristics can be defined as a simple / relaxed version of the problem

Let h1, h2 be heuristic functions

h1 > h2
iif fewer nodes are expanded during the search when for h1

Examples:
![[Pasted image 20250218102101.png]]

### Best First Search
- expand minimal cost nodes first
- not guaranteed shortest path
- don't revisit nodes for efficiency(only if you want shortest)
	- restrict legal moves not include visited nodes
- Open and Closed List
	- Open - evaluated but not expanded
	- Closed - Visited

### Hill Climb
- Consider only local states
![[Pasted image 20250220115928.png]]
- hence we don't go from F2 to B3
![[Pasted image 20250220120016.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250220120024.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250220120036.png]]

### Greedy Hill climb
- Choose node with least estimated cost at each state
- Can get stuck (current is best)
- Must go up 
![[Pasted image 20250220120152.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250220120201.png]]

### The A algorithm
- Best first search with this algorithm:
  ![[Pasted image 20250220120318.png]]
- g(n) -> length from state n to start n
- h(n) -> heuristic measure 

### The A* algorithm
- admissible
![[Pasted image 20250220120651.png]]
- g*(n) -> estimate shortest path from start node to node n
- h*(n) -> estimate actual cost from goal node that passes through n
- f* does not exist in practice, we estimate it f as closely as possible to f
- g(n) <= g*(n)
- h*(n) is usually non computable
	- instead find h(n) that is bounded from above the actual cost of the shortest path to the goal
	- h(n) <= h*(n)
	- if true then A is called A* algorithm

**Advantages**
- Shortest path guaranteed
	- needs admissible h(n) -> doesn't over estimate
	- consistent h(n) -> est. cost from node to goal < cost of transition(neighbor) to goal
- Complete, if sol exist it'll be found (dna to infinite nodes/cost)
- Efficient: heuristic guided searching
- Wide Application

**Disadvantages**
- Heuristic quality dependent
- Long search times for underestimated costs
- if overestimate non optimal cost may be found 
- Memory consumption
- Complexity


### Branch and Bound
- find most optimal solution
- provide a cost to each path
