# Intro

Artificial Intelligence is the field of training computers to perform manual labor we don't want to do but otherwise can't implement with robotics or simple algorithms.

This can be done by replicating human intelligence

Turing Test 
- meow

Chinese room
- non Chinese speaker in a room with documents that contain instructions and correlations 
- Chinese note is passed in
- person must use provided materials to craft a Chinese response

#### Search
- Search a state space of possible solutions to solve a problem
- e.g.) depth first, breadth first, heuristic searches

#### Knowledge representation 
- Methods of representing knowledge that the computer needs to think intelligently and sole problems
- e.g.) semantic networks, predicate logic etc.

### Programming languages
- Prolog and Lisp were developed as languages at the time were deemed inappropriate 

#### Prolog
- Declarative programming paradigm 
- Based on mathematical formalisms (first order predicate logic)

#### Lisp
- List Processing
- Functional Programming paradigm 
- Basis -> Recursive function theory

Nowadays C, C++, Java, Python, small talk etc. can be used

# State Space Representation and Search

AI problems must first be represented as a state space.
The state space is then searched to determine a solution to the problem .

#### State Space
- Set of nodes representing each state of the problem
- Transitions represented by arcs between nodes
- Initial and Goal state
- State spaces manifest into a tree or a graph 
- Selection of search technique is dependent on a contingent of factors such as nature of problem and potential representation

**Search techniques in course**:

### Classic Problems
#### Travelling salesman
- Sales must visit each city exactly once
- Find the shortest trip that starts at x and ends at y

#### Tower of Hanoi
- meow

#### 8-Puzzle
- Tiles on a board with a black space
- tiles can transition into spaces
- Goal is to get a specific configuration


### Problem Representation

- Graph

- Transitions abide by the rules of the game


**Eight-Puzzle**
- Legal Move : Moving the Space
- Space can be moved up down left right

#### General
- State Space: Set of descriptions or states
- Search Problem:
	- Initial state/s
	- set of legal actions (action is operator/move on a state)
	- Goal state/s
- Operator count is problem dependent and specific to a particular representation 
	- More operator = More Branching Factor (i.e. keep it min)
- Runtime vs Advance 
	- only solve specific config 
- Search algorithms are applied to find a solution path


## Graphs vs Trees
If states in a solution space can be revisited more than once, a directed graph is used to represent the solution state 

**Graph**
- Multiple sequences from node x to node y
- Moves can be undone
- More than one path to the goal
	- Path is more distinguished in a tree
	- Goal's may have to appear more than once in a tree
- Search algo's must consider possible loops and cycles
	- Tree's may be more efficient is no loops or cycles
- Entire tree's / graph's aren't generated

# Heuristic Search
If we want to reduce the size of the search space (which can be memory cumbersome with DFS and BFS) we cab use a heuristic search instead by applying an evaluation function to each goal to assess how promising it is in leading to the goal

**Heuristic searches**
- Best First Search
- A* algorithm
- Hill Climbing 
Use some domain specific knowledge to choose next node to search.
- Weak search methods : using heuristics to determine next node

## Calculating Heuristics
Heuristics may find a solution but it's not guaranteed.
Heuristic functions: Estimate cost from a node to the goal node.

Using heuristics while searching should hopefully speed up the search process but heuristic functions aren't always accurate (if they were there would be no need for a search process)

**Heuristic value**: approximate cost of finding solution
Heuristic value >= 0 for all nodes.
If HV == 0
	Goal state 

**Admissible Heuristic**: Never over estimates cost of a node
- not all heuristics are admissible

if HV == infinity
	Dead end (doesn't lead anywhere)

Good Heuristics are not computationally expensive.

Heuristics can be defined as a simple / relaxed version of the problem

Let h1, h2 be heuristic functions

h1 > h2
iif fewer nodes are expanded during the search when for h1
