Given that ACO and Genetic Programming have been recently tested, you'll want to focus on other algorithms that lend themselves well to application-based questions, especially those involving calculations or step-by-step tracing. Here's a breakdown of algorithms and formulas to prioritize:

**1. A* Search Algorithm:**

- **Core Task**: Finding the shortest path in a graph using a heuristic.
- **Key Formula**:
    - **Evaluation Function**: f(n)=g(n)+h(n)
        - g(n): Cost from the start node to node n (actual cost).
        - h(n): Heuristic estimate of the cost from node n to the goal.
- **Application Focus**:
    - Tracing the A* algorithm: showing the OPEN and CLOSED lists, and the f,g,h values for expanded nodes.
    - Determining the solution path and its cost.
    - Assessing if a given heuristic h(n) is **admissible** (i.e., h(n)≤h∗(n), where h∗(n) is the true cost to the goal) by comparing heuristic estimates to actual path costs.

**2. ID3 Algorithm (Decision Tree Induction):**

- **Core Task**: Building a decision tree from a dataset.
- **Key Formulas**:
    - **Entropy E(S)** (for a set S with k classes, pi​ is proportion of class i): E(S)=∑i=1k​−pi​log2​pi​ (For binary classification with p positive and n negative instances: E(S)=p+n−p​log2​(p+np​)−p+nn​log2​(p+nn​))
    - **Information Gain Gain(S,A)** (for a set S and attribute A): Gain(S,A)=E(S)−∑v∈Values(A)​∣S∣∣Sv​∣​E(Sv​) where Sv​ is the subset of S for which attribute A has value v.
- **Application Focus**:
    - Calculating entropy for the entire dataset and for subsets based on attribute values.
    - Calculating information gain for different attributes to select the best split (e.g., the root node or subsequent nodes).
    - Manually constructing parts of a decision tree.

**3. K-Means Clustering:**

- **Core Task**: Partitioning a dataset into K distinct clusters.
- **Key Formulas/Concepts**:
    - **Euclidean Distance** between points x=(x1​,...,xm​) and y=(y1​,...,ym​): d(x,y)=∑i=1m​(xi​−yi​)2![](data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="400em" height="1.28em" viewBox="0 0 400000 1296" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin slice"><path d="M263,681c0.7,0,18,39.7,52,119

    - **Centroid Calculation**: The mean of all data points in a cluster for each dimension.
- **Application Focus**:
    - Performing iterations of the K-Means algorithm:
        1. Assigning data points to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance.
        2. Recalculating new centroids after assignments.
    - Tracking cluster assignments and centroid positions through iterations.

**4. Backpropagation (for Multi-Layer Perceptrons):**

- **Core Task**: Training an Artificial Neural Network by adjusting weights.
- **Key Formulas** (using sigmoid activation f(net)=1+e−net1​, so f′(net)=f(net)(1−f(net))):
    - **Net input** to a neuron j: netj​=∑i​wji​oi​+bj​. (As in n1j​ and n2m​ calculations)
    - **Output (activation)** of neuron j: oj​=f(netj​).
    - **Error term for an output unit k (δk​)**: δk​=(targetk​−ok​)⋅ok​(1−ok​).
    - **Error term for a hidden unit j (δj​)**: δj​=(∑k​δk​wkj​)⋅oj​(1−oj​).
    - **Weight update (Δwji​)**: Δwji​=η⋅δj​⋅oi​ (where oi​ is output of unit i feeding into unit j, η is learning rate).
    - New weight: wji​(new)=wji​(old)+Δwji​.
- **Application Focus**:
    - Performing a **forward pass**: calculating outputs of hidden and output layers given inputs and initial weights.
    - Calculating **error terms (δ)** for output and hidden units.
    - Calculating **weight updates** for one or more weights for a single iteration/epoch.

**5. Perceptron (Single Layer):**

- **Core Task**: Simple binary classification or finding separating hyperplanes.
- **Key Formulas**:
    - **Net input**: yin​=∑i​wi​xi​+b (bias b is often included).
    - **Activation Function** (e.g., Step function as in): ϕ(y)={10​if y>Tif y≤T​ (Threshold T is often 0).
    - **Perceptron Learning Rule** (for training, if asked): wi​(new)=wi​(old)+α(t−o)xi​; b(new)=b(old)+α(t−o) (where t is target, o is output, α is learning rate).
- **Application Focus**:
    - Calculating the output of a perceptron given specific inputs, weights, and an activation function.
    - Finding a set of weights (and bias) that correctly classifies a small given set of input-output pairs (often by setting up and solving inequalities).

**6. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):**

- **Core Task**: Optimization, particularly in continuous spaces.
- **Key Formulas**:
    - **Velocity Update**: vi​(t+1)=w⋅vi​(t)+c1​⋅r1​⋅(pi​−xi​(t))+c2​⋅r2​⋅(g−xi​(t))
    - **Position Update**: xi​(t+1)=xi​(t)+vi​(t+1)
- **Application Focus**:
    - Performing one or two iterations of PSO:
        1. Evaluate fitness of particles at current positions.
        2. Update personal best (pi​) and global best (g) positions.
        3. Calculate new velocities using the velocity update formula.
        4. Calculate new positions using the position update formula.
    - You would need to be given or choose values for w,c1​,c2​ and generate random r1​,r2​.

**7. Grammatical Evolution (GE):**

- **Core Task**: Evolving programs or expressions using a grammar.
- **Key Formula/Process**:
    - **Mapping Rule**: `Rule_index = (codon_decimal_value) % (Number_of_production_rules_for_current_non_terminal)`
- **Application Focus**:
    - Given a genotype (string of codons) and a BNF grammar, derive the corresponding phenotype (expression/program) by systematically converting codons to decimal, applying the mapping rule to select productions, and replacing non-terminals.

**8. Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning:**

- **Core Task**: Decision making in two-player zero-sum games.
- **Key Concepts/Formulas**:
    - **Minimax Values**: MAX nodes choose the maximum value of their children; MIN nodes choose the minimum value.
    - **Alpha-Beta Pruning Condition**: Prune if α≥β.
        - α: Best score MAX can guarantee so far on the path.
        - β: Best score MIN can guarantee so far on the path.
- **Application Focus**:
    - Applying the Minimax algorithm to a game tree to determine the optimal move and game value.
    - Tracing Alpha-Beta pruning: showing how α and β values are updated and identifying which branches are pruned and why.

While other topics like KNN, basic DFS/BFS tracing, and conceptual understanding of CNN layers or Hopfield network weight setting are also important, the ones listed above have more explicit formulas and step-by-step calculation processes that are frequently tested in application-style questions. Focus on understanding _how_ to apply these formulas and processes to given data or scenarios.
