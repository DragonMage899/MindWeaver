## 🧬 Genetic Programming (GP)

### 🌱 Core Idea

Genetic Programming is an **extension of Genetic Algorithms**, where **entire programs or expressions** (instead of fixed-length chromosomes) are evolved to solve a task. The solutions are typically represented as **syntax trees**.

### 🧠 What It Evolves

- Programs (decision-making logic, expressions, models)
    
- Represented as **tree structures** (e.g., `(+ x (* 3 y))`)
    

### 🔁 Algorithm Workflow

1. **Initialize** a population of random program trees using a set of functions and terminals.
    
2. **Evaluate** each program's fitness (how well it solves the problem).
    
3. **Select** high-fitness programs.
    
4. **Apply genetic operators**:
    
    - **Crossover**: Swap subtrees between parents.
        
    - **Mutation**: Replace a subtree with a randomly generated one.
        
5. **Form new generation** and repeat.
    

### 🔧 Components

- **Function Set**: Operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `sin`, `if`, etc.).
    
- **Terminal Set**: Variables and constants (e.g., `x`, `5`, `true`).
    
- **Fitness Function**: Measures how well a program performs on a task (e.g., prediction error, classification accuracy).
    

### 🛠 When to Use

- When the structure of the solution is **unknown or flexible**.
    
- Symbolic regression, evolving rules or expressions, game strategies, control systems, etc.
    

### 🧠 Tips for Real-World Use

- **Control bloat**: Program trees can grow excessively. Use **parsimony pressure** (penalize complexity).
    
- Use **strongly typed GP** for tasks with specific input/output types.
    
- Limit tree depth or use **dynamic depth control**.
    
- GP can be computationally expensive — use parallel evaluation if possible.
