- Render Semi Translucent glass wall
- Light Shining through it
- Light projected onto a sheet
- Ability to adjust number of vertices of sheet







## Project Setup and Core Concepts:

- **OpenGL Version:** Ensure you are strictly using OpenGL 3.3 as specified.
    
- **No GLM:** Continue with your custom matrix and vector math. Lecture 12 and 13 on Viewing Transformations (Chapter 8) will be crucial here, as they detail the matrices you'll need to implement (Viewport, Orthographic, Camera, and Perspective).
    
- **Custom Shapes:** Your `shapes3.h` and the `Plane` class in `plane.h` provide a good foundation. You'll extend this to create the specific shapes required for Practical 4.
- **Shaders:** You'll need vertex and fragment shaders. The fragment shader will be particularly important for implementing lighting and translucency.
- **Window Title:** Remember to set your window title to your student number.
    
- **Included Libraries:** Stick to the allowed libraries: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `iostream`, `iomanip`, `cmath`, `sstream`, `GL/glew.h`, `GLFW/glfw3.h`, and `shader.hpp` / `glad.c`.
    

## Step-by-Step Guide for Practical 4:

Here's how you can tackle the requirements based on `COS344_P4_2025.pdf`:

### 1. Shape Requirements

You need to render a scene with a Backsheet, a semi-translucent Glass block, and a Bottomsheet.

- **Backsheet:**
    - This should be a solid wall composed of a configurable number of smaller rectangles. The number of rectangles will be a command-line argument.
        
    - Refer to your `Cube` or `Rectangle3D` class in `shapes3.h`. You'll need to adapt it to create a flat surface made of multiple segments.
    - The practical mentions potential rounding errors causing slits at certain angles; this is noted and won't penalize you.
        
- **Glass:**
    - A semi-translucent box with the same height and length as the backsheet.
        
    - Its thickness should not exceed 0.2 units within the default clipping window.
        
    - It needs to be positioned in the middle between the light source and the backsheet.
        
    - **Translucency and Face Ordering:** This is critical. The faces of the glass must be rendered in the correct order for translucency to appear correctly.
        
        - You'll need to enable blending: `glEnable(GL_BLEND);` and `glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);`.
        - For correct order, you might need to sort the faces of the glass cube from back to front relative to the camera before drawing them each frame, or draw the back faces then the front faces. Consider the camera's position when determining this order. The bonus marks mention using a Binary Search Tree Partitioning algorithm for sorting glass faces, which is an advanced technique.
            
    - Light should shine _through_ it, not reflect off it in terms of ray bouncing (though the light's color _will_ be affected by the glass).
        
    - You can use your `Cube` class from `shapes3.h` as a starting point. You'll need to add alpha values to its color.
- **Bottomsheet:**
    - A simple rectangle spanning from the backsheet, under the glass, to the same Z plane as the light's initial position.
        
    - It should have the same length as the backsheet and glass.
        
    - This can be a single `Rectangle3D` or a modified `Cube` with minimal height.

Drawing 3D Shapes (Reference your plane.h):

Your plane.h demonstrates creating a complex object from simpler Shapes3D primitives (Cube, TriangularPrism, Cone, Cylinder). You assemble these, apply transformations (translation, rotation) relative to a central point or each other, and then draw them. You will use a similar approach:

1. Define classes for `Backsheet`, `Glass`, and `Bottomsheet`, likely inheriting from or composed of your `Shapes3D` or primitive shape classes (`Cube`, `Rectangle3D`).
2. In your main loop, after setting up transformations, call the `draw()` method for each of these objects.

### 2. Color Requirements

- **Backsheet Colors:**
    
    - Cycle through Red, Green, Blue, White, Black, and 5 other distinct colors using two chosen keyboard keys.
    - Implement a mechanism to store these colors (e.g., an array of `Vector<3>` for RGB) and an index to cycle through them.
- **Glass Colors & Alpha:**
    - Cycle through Red, Green, Blue, White, Black, and 5 other distinct colors using two different keyboard keys.
        
    - **Alpha Control:** Use two further keys to control the alpha value of the glass. This will affect its translucency. You'll need to pass this alpha value to your shader.
        
    - Your `Shape` class in `shapes2.h` already has a `float color[4]`, which can store RGBA. Ensure your `Shapes3D` and its constituent parts correctly handle and pass this fourth (alpha) component to the shader. The `updateOpacity` method in `shapes2.h` and `shapes3.h` is a good starting point.
- **Light Colors:**
    
    - Cycle through Red, Green, Blue, White, and 5 other distinct colors using two different keyboard keys.
- **Bottomsheet Color:**
    - Standard grey, unaffected by the light.
        
- **Color Buffer:** Ensure your color buffer is set up for RGBA.
    
- **Color Interaction:**
    - The glass color should affect the backsheet's color when viewed through the glass. This is a natural result of blending.
    - The glass should also affect the color of the light projected onto the backsheet. When light passes through the colored glass, its color should be modulated. In your fragment shader, when calculating the light's contribution on the backsheet, if the light ray passed through the glass, the light's color should be multiplied by the glass's color.
        

### 3. Light Requirements

- **Point Light Source:** The light should be a point light.
    
    - **Lecture 4 (Chapter 4.5 & 5):** Provides the pseudo-code and theory for point light illumination. You'll need its position and color (intensity).
        
    - The calculation typically involves:
        - Light direction vector (from surface point to light source).
        - Normal vector of the surface at that point.
        - View direction vector (from surface point to camera).
        - Attenuation based on distance (1/r2).
            
        - Diffuse reflection (Lambertian): `max(0, dot(normal, lightDir))`.
            
        - Optionally, specular reflection (e.g., Blinn-Phong): using a half-vector. Practical 4 specifies using at least the pseudo-code from Chapter 4 of the textbook, which covers basic illumination.
            
- **Projection on Backsheet:** The light's projection is only displayed on the backsheet.
    
    - This means you'll calculate lighting for fragment points on the backsheet.
    - When a fragment on the backsheet is being rendered, you'll calculate the light's influence. If the "view" from the light source to this fragment on the backsheet is obstructed by the (translucent) glass, the light's color should be filtered by the glass's color and alpha.
- **Implementation in Shader:**
    - **Vertex Shader:** Transform vertex positions and normals to view space or world space (ensure consistency). Pass these to the fragment shader.
    - **Fragment Shader:**
        - Receive interpolated normals, vertex positions (to calculate light/view vectors).
        - Receive light properties (position, color) as uniforms.
        - Receive glass properties (color, alpha if needed for the light calculation logic) as uniforms.
        - Calculate diffuse (and optionally specular) components.
        - The light's color used for calculation on the backsheet should be `light_original_color * glass_color` if it passes through the glass. The intensity might also be attenuated by the glass's alpha.
        - Combine with object's base color.

### 4. Transformation Requirements

- **No Built-in Transformations:** You must implement all transformations from first principles using your matrix arithmetic, not built-in OpenGL functions like `glRotate`, `glTranslate`. Your `Matrix.h` and the transformation methods in `shapes3.h` (`translate`, `rotate`) are designed for this.
    
- **Scene Rotations (W, S, A, D, E, Q):**
    
    - These keys rotate the _entire scene_ (Backsheet, Glass, Bottomsheet, and the Light source) around the world X, Y, and Z axes.
    - You'll apply a single rotation matrix (updated by these keys) to all objects before their individual model transformations. This is effectively a camera manipulation achieved by transforming the world.
    - **Lecture 12 (Chapter 8):** Covers camera transformation (`Mcam`). You can think of these scene rotations as modifying the camera's view matrix. The transformation should be applied consistently so that pressing a key multiple times continues the rotation without resetting.
        
- **Light Translations (Arrow Keys, 'm', 'n'):**
    
    - These keys move _only the light source_. The rest of the scene remains static.
    - Update the light's position uniform in your shader based on these inputs.
    - Translations should be relative to the scene's current orientation if the scene itself has been rotated.
        
- **Projection Matrices:**
    - **Lecture 12 & 13 (Chapter 8):** Detail the orthographic (`Morth`) and perspective (`Mper` or `Morth * P`) projection matrices. Practical 4 uses a perspective view. You'll need `Mvp` (viewport), `Mper` (perspective projection), and `Mcam` (camera/view).
        
    - The final transformation for a vertex would be `Mvp * Mper * Mcam * Mmodel * vertex`. Remember the division by `w` after perspective projection.
        
    - The practical specifies that the camera looks along the -Z axis. Your projection matrix should be set up accordingly, defining near and far planes (`n` and `f`). The field-of-view (FOV) can be used to determine the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` parameters for the projection matrix.
        

### 5. Implementation Details from Lectures:

- **Lecture 3 (Chapter 4 - Ray Tracing):** While Practical 4 is rasterization-based, the concepts of viewing rays, ray-object intersection (conceptually, how light interacts), and camera frames are foundational. The perspective projection math is key.
    
- **Lecture 4 (Chapter 4.5 - Shading, Chapter 5 - Surface Shading):**
    - **Light Sources:** Understand point lights.
        
    - **Basic Reflection Models:** Lambertian reflection is essential. Blinn-Phong for specular highlights is good practice but verify if strictly required beyond the "pseudo code described in Chapter 4".
        
    - **Shading Calculation:** Algorithm 1 (Point Light Illumination) and Algorithm 2 (Ambient Light) are directly relevant. The practical focuses on a point light, but a small ambient term is often good to have so shadowed areas aren't pitch black.
        
    - **Shadows:** The practical doc doesn't explicitly ask for shadow casting _from_ the glass/backsheet onto the bottom sheet, but it _does_ require the light to project _through_ the glass onto the backsheet. The concept of a shadow ray is useful: to determine the light on the backsheet, you'd check if the path from the light to the backsheet point is clear or passes through the glass.
        
- **Lecture 12 & 13 (Chapter 8 - Viewing):** These are critical for setting up your rendering pipeline without GLM.
    - **Viewport Transformation (`Mvp`):** Maps canonical view volume to screen coordinates.
        
    - **Orthographic Projection (`Morth`):** Defines an axis-aligned box view volume.
        
    - **Camera Transformation (`Mcam`):** Positions and orientates the camera (or conversely, the world).
        
    - **Perspective Projection (`P` or `Mper`):** Implements the perspective divide. You'll use `Mper = Morth * P`.
        
    - **Sequence:** `M = Mvp * Mper * Mcam`. You'll then multiply this combined matrix by your object's model matrix and then by the vertex coordinates. Remember the homogeneous divide for perspective.
        

### Tips for Your `Shapes3D` and `Plane.h` Structure:

- **Encapsulation:** Continue encapsulating vertices, indices (if used for element drawing), color, and transformation logic within your shape classes.
- **Transformations:** Your `Shapes3D::rotate` and `Shapes3D::translate` methods which modify a `transform` matrix are good. Ensure these are applied correctly as model matrices. For scene rotations, you'll modify the view matrix (`Mcam`).
- **Drawing:** The `draw()` method in `Shapes3D` iterates through its constituent `Shape` objects and applies the accumulated `transform`. This is a viable approach. Ensure each sub-shape's `draw()` method correctly binds its VBO/VAO and makes the `glDrawArrays` or `glDrawElements` call.

This is a substantial practical. Break it down into smaller, manageable tasks:

1. Get the static scene rendering (Backsheet, Glass, Bottomsheet) with basic colors.
2. Implement the keyboard controls for color changes.
3. Implement translucency for the Glass (blending and alpha control).
4. Implement the point light source and its basic effect on the Backsheet (ignoring glass interaction first).
5. Implement the light's interaction with the Glass (color filtering).
6. Implement scene rotations.
7. Implement light translations.

Good luck! Remember to test each part incrementally.
