# Logic / Declarative languages
- specify form of result
- Not the procedure for producing them

Proposition: Logical statement that may be true or false
- Objects & relationships between objects

Symbolic Logic
- Express propositions 
- Express relationships
- Describe how to infer new propositions

## **First Order Predicate calculus**
- Symbolic logic used for logic programming 
- Object Representation
	- Constant
		- Symbol representing an object
	- Variable
		- Symbol that can represent different objects at different times
		- Different from imperative 
- Propositions
	- **Atomic**
		- Like a mathematical function
		- Functor : Symbol that names relation
		- Ordered Tuple of parameters
