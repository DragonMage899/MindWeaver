Imperative languages are abstractions of von neuman architecture 
- Memory
- Processor 

**Variables** 
- Abstraction of memory cell
- has attributes

**Names**
- Design issues:
	- Length
	- Special Char
	- Case sensitivity

# Variables
- Attributes
	- Name
	- Address
		- If names address the same address => alias
	- Value
	- Type
		- Determines
			- Set of possible variables
			- Set of operations 
			- How it's stored in memory
	- Lifetime
	- Scope

# Binding 
- Simple association
	- Attribute and entity 
		- Variable and it's type
	- Operation and symbol
		- *  means multiply 
- It takes time to bind 

## Times

## Static vs Dynamic
Static
- Binds before runtime
- Remains unchanged during execution

Dynamic
- Binds during execution
- can change

## Type Binding 
- Binding of a variable to a type
