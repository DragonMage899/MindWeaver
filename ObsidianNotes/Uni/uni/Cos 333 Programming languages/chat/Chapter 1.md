# Exam notes
## **1. Reasons for Studying Programming Languages**

### **Why Learn Multiple Languages?**

- **Expanded Problem-Solving Skills**:
    
    - Different languages encourage different ways of thinking (e.g., functional vs. imperative).
        
    - Example: Learning recursion in Lisp/Scheme helps write cleaner loops in Java.
        
- **Better Language Selection for Projects**:
    
    - A Python developer might choose C++ for performance-critical applications.
        
    - Example: JavaScript for web front-end vs. C for embedded systems.
        
- **Easier Learning of New Languages**:
    
    - Understanding paradigms (OOP, functional, logic) makes learning Rust, Go, or Swift easier.
        
    - Example: A Java programmer can quickly learn C# due to similar syntax.
        
- **Understanding Implementation Trade-offs**:
    
    - Knowing how garbage collection works helps optimize memory in Python/Java.
        
    - Example: Avoiding excessive object creation in real-time systems.
        

**Exam Focus**:

- Be prepared to explain how learning multiple paradigms (OOP, functional, procedural) improves adaptability.
    
- Example question: _"How does studying Lisp influence a programmer’s approach to problem-solving in Java?"_

## **2. Language Evaluation Criteria**

### **(a) Readability**

- **Simplicity**:
    
    - Fewer constructs → easier to learn (e.g., Python vs. C++).
        
    - _Too much simplicity_ can reduce expressiveness (e.g., Assembly lacks high-level abstractions).
        
- **Orthogonality**:
    
    - Small set of constructs that combine predictably (e.g., UNIX shell commands vs. APL’s complex symbols).
        
    - _Excessive orthogonality_ can lead to overly complex expressions (e.g., ALGOL 68).
        
- **Syntax Design**:
    
    - Meaningful keywords (`if`, `while`) vs. cryptic symbols (`?:` in C).
        
    - Example: Ada’s `end if` vs. C’s `}` for block termination.
        

### **(b) Writability**

- **Expressiveness**:
    
    - Concise syntax for common tasks (e.g., Python’s `list comprehension` vs. Java loops).
        
    - Example: Perl’s powerful regex support vs. C’s manual string parsing.
        
- **Support for Abstraction**:
    
    - Functions, classes, and modules reduce code duplication.
        
    - Example: C macros vs. C++ templates.
        

### **(c) Reliability**

- **Type Checking**:
    
    - Static (C++, Java) catches errors early; dynamic (Python, JavaScript) allows flexibility.
        
    - Example: Java’s `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` vs. C’s silent buffer overflows.
        
- **Exception Handling**:
    
    - Structured error recovery (Java `try-catch`) vs. C’s error-code returns.
        
- **Aliasing Issues**:
    
    - Multiple references to the same memory (e.g., pointers in C) can cause bugs.
        

### **(d) Cost**

- **Development Cost**:
    
    - High-level languages (Python) reduce coding time vs. low-level (C).
        
- **Execution Cost**:
    
    - Interpreted languages (Python) are slower than compiled (C).
        
- **Maintenance Cost**:
    
    - Readability affects long-term bug fixes (e.g., COBOL’s verbosity vs. Python’s clarity).
        

**Exam Focus**:

- Compare two languages (e.g., Java vs. Python) on readability, writability, and reliability.
    
- Example question: _"Why is C less reliable than Java? Provide specific language features."_

- **Needs**: Symbolic computation, recursion, flexibility.
    
- **Why Lisp?** Homoiconicity (code as data), dynamic typing.
    

### **(d) Web Development (JavaScript, PHP, HTML/CSS)**

- **Needs**: Dynamic content, client-server interaction.
    
- **Why JavaScript?** Runs in browsers; event-driven model.
    

**Exam Focus**:

## **4. Influences on Language Design**

### **(a) Von Neumann Architecture**

- Imperative languages (C, Java) mirror CPU operations:
    
    - Variables ≈ memory cells.
        
    - Assignment ≈ data movement.
        
    - Loops ≈ jump instructions.
        

### **(b) Programming Methodologies**

- **Procedural (1970s)**: Structured programming (avoid `goto`).
    
- **Object-Oriented (1980s+)**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
    
- **Functional (Lisp, Haskell)**: Immutable data, recursion.
    

**Exam Focus**:

- Explain how hardware (von Neumann) shapes language design.
    
- Example question: _"How does the von Neumann bottleneck affect language efficiency?"_

## **5. Implementation Methods**

|**Method**|**How It Works**|**Pros & Cons**|**Examples**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Compilation**|Source → Machine Code|Fast execution; hard to debug.|C, C++, Rust|

## **6. Key Concepts for Exams**

### **(a) Orthogonality**

- **Good**: UNIX commands (`ls`, `grep`) combine predictably.
    
- **Bad**: C’s `static` has multiple meanings (file scope vs. persistence).
    

### **(b) Type Systems**

- **Static (C++, Java)**: Checks at compile-time.
    
- **Dynamic (Python, JavaScript)**: Checks at runtime.
    

### **(c) Syntax vs. Semantics**

- **Syntax**: Rules (e.g., `if (x > 0)`).
    
- **Semantics**: Meaning (e.g., `if` executes block when true).
    

### **(d) Object-Oriented Principles**

- **Encapsulation**: Hide data (private variables).
    
- **Inheritance**: Reuse code (`class B extends A`).
    
- **Polymorphism**: One interface, multiple implementations (method overriding).
    

**Exam Focus**:

- Define and give examples of OOP principles.
    
- Example question: _"How does polymorphism improve code reusability?"_

2. **Historical Context**: Know why languages evolved (e.g., C → C++ → Java).
    
3. **Trade-offs**: Every design choice has pros/cons (e.g., static vs. dynamic typing).
    
4. **Examples Matter**: Use real languages (Fortran, Lisp, Java) in answers.
