You'll deploy security controls to protect your target
- e.g) Security keys (access control, threat actors can't access account even if pw compromised) 
- Need processes and procedures in place 

## Frameworks and control
- Identify organisation critical assets and risks
- Implement frameworks and controls to manage risks and protect these assets

**Security Frameworks**
- Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy
- Provide a structured approach to implement security life cycle
	- Set of policies and standards for managing risks, following guidelines and conforming to laws
- Protecting PII
- Securing financial information
- Identifying Security weaknesses
- Managing organisational risks 
- Aligning security with business goals

Components of Frameworks
- Goals
	- e.g) Identify and document areas where gdpr is not adhered to (eu user data law) 
- Guidelines
	- e.g) Updating policies for data requests from users (gdpr)
- Processes
	- e.g) Design procedures for user info update 
- Communication (of results)
	- Monitor internal network and report issues

Frameworks allow analyst to document, implement and use policies that have been created
Affects how different people collaborate


**Security Controls**
- Safeguard against specific security risks
	- e.g) Data security training
	- Track who completed the training


## Secure Design
- Using specific frameworks and controls to minimise risk and protect users

**CIA triad**
- Foundational Model that helps to inform how orgs consider risks when creating polices and setting up systems
- CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
	- Confidentiality: Access control to assets (data)
	- Integrity: Correct, Authentic and reliable data (e.g: end to end encryption)
	- Availability: Data is accessible to people who have access to it   

Asset: Item with some form of value
- value: cost associated with the value

**NIST CSF(Cyber sec framework)**
- Voluntary framework that consists of standards guidelines and best practises to manage cyber security risks
- Baseline for managing short and long term risks
