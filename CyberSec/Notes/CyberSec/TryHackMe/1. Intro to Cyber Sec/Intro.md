# Defensive Security 

Offensive security focuses on breaking into systems (exploit bugs, abuse insecure steps, take advantage of bad access control - Red teams)
Defensive security is the opposite
- Prevents intrusion
- Detect intrusion and respond'

Tasks:
- User cyber security awareness : Training users to protect against attacks
- Documenting and managing assets : Know types of systems and devices that we need to protect
- Updating and Patching Systems : Ensure that systems are patched against security
- Logging and Monitoring : Detect malicious activities

## Areas of Defensive Security 
- Security Operations Centre (SOC) - Threat intelligence 
- Digital Forensics and Incident response (DFIR) - Malware analysis

SOC's
- Monitor Networks and systems and detects malicious/ suspicious activities.
	- Discovers vulnerability and prevent exploitation 
	- Ensure users are adhering to security policies 
	- Monitor for unauthorised access (password stolen)
	- Monitor for network intrusions (link)
