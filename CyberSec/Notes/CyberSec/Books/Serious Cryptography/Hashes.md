Preimage M -> is the message to be hashed 

Preimage resistance
- Security guarantee that given a random Hash, an attacker will find a preimage of that hash

Collisions may occur (pigeon hole)

First premiage
- can't message message given a hash

Second preimage
- Given some message M1
- Impossible to find M2 that hashes to the same value as M1
