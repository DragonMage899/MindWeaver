**Kerckhoffs’s principle**
```
A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge
```
### Transposition ciphers
clear text → p i c o
encrypted text → o p i c

#### Vigenere Cypher
Key = key
plaintext = dragon are cool

To encrypt:
dragonsarecool (14)
keykeykeykeyke (14)

row is text
column is key

(k,d) -> M
(e,r) -> V
...
Cipher text: VM...

to decrypt use repeated key:
(k, f(V)) -> d
...

# AES
Fixes key lengths
aes 128, aes 256 ... determines the key length size

Operation modes
ECB: maintains byte order
- can still get info
- penguin pic


CBC: xor the first block a random init vector of size key
- Ensures if we send the same message twice it looks different
- Need to send the random init vector with the message
