Exploiting a program is a clever way of getting it to do what you want it to do even if the running program was designed to prevent this action. 
Security holes are design flaws
- can be simple for complex where advanced techniques are used 

Code can be like a genie, it'll so exactly what you ask it to do even if it does not adhere to the intended usage.

When unicode was first introduced we had had multiple symbols for "/" which allowed users to access directories they should have had access to (from root)


## Generalised Exploit techniques

- Taking advantage of common mistakes that are hard to catch in development and production
- Buffer overflow and String exploits 
	- Take control of the targets execution flow by tricking it into running a piece of malicious code that has been smuggled into memory
	- Execution or arbitrary code
	- Normally causes a program to crash
	- Thus requires a careful control of the environment
