### ✅ 1. **Custom Wordlist Generator with Context Awareness**

**Focus:** Reconnaissance, Credential Stuffing  
**What you’ll build:** A tool that scrapes metadata (e.g. from LinkedIn, company pages, breaches) and generates targeted wordlists based on employee names, patterns, and permutations.  
**Research needed:** Common password patterns, social engineering techniques, company OSINT.  
**Why it's good:** Shows practical Red Team thinking and automation.

---

### ✅ 2. **Simple C2 (Command & Control) Framework (Educational)**

**Focus:** Post-Exploitation / Red Team  
**What you’ll build:** A basic HTTP- or DNS-based C2 server and implant in Python or Go — enough to demonstrate beaconing, tasking, and basic command exec.  
**Research needed:** C2 communication techniques, evasion, malware structure.  
**Caution:** Emphasize that it’s for educational/research purposes only.  
**Why it’s good:** Demonstrates low-level understanding of post-exploitation tooling.

---

### ✅ 3. **Automated Subdomain Enumeration + Takeover Detection**

**Focus:** Recon / Web Security  
**What you’ll build:** A script or mini-tool that:

- Finds subdomains via OSINT (crt.sh, DNS, etc.)
    
- Checks for dead or dangling subdomains (S3, Heroku, GitHub Pages, etc.)  
    **Research needed:** Third-party services vulnerable to subdomain takeovers.  
    **Why it’s good:** Real-world, shows initiative, extensible.

### ✅ 4. **Malware Sandbox Analyzer (Basic Static + Behavioral Analysis)**

**Focus:** Malware Research  
**What you’ll build:** A lightweight sandbox-like environment (e.g., in Docker or a VM) that performs static inspection + basic behavior logging (file writes, network calls).  
**Research needed:** Windows/Linux system behavior, malware evasion tricks.  
**Why it’s good:** Highlights threat research skills and safe malware handling.

---

### ✅ 5. **Vulnerability Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Reimplementation**

**Focus:** Exploit Dev / CVE Research  
**What you’ll do:** Pick a recent CVE (ideally one you analyzed during your internship), reimplement the PoC, and explain the root cause and exploit chain in a blog-style README.  
**Research needed:** Vulnerability class, patch diffing, affected software.  
**Why it’s good:** Extremely relevant to Red Team roles, builds credibility.

---

### ✅ 6. **SSH Honeypot with Logging + Analysis**

**Focus:** Threat Intel / Offensive Security  
**What you’ll build:** A fake SSH server (e.g., using `Cowrie` or custom lightweight version) that logs attacker behavior and credentials.  
**Add-on:** Create a simple dashboard summarizing common IPs, commands, attempted credentials.  
**Why it’s good:** Shows initiative, ability to handle attacker data, and storytelling.

---

### ✅ 7. **Payload Obfuscator / Crypter (Educational)**

**Focus:** AV Evasion / Malware Dev  
**What you’ll build:** A small tool that encrypts or obfuscates a payload and generates a stub to decrypt/execute it.  
**Research needed:** PE/ELF formats, static AV detection techniques, Windows APIs.  
**Why it’s good:** Demonstrates technical depth and creativity.

## ⚙️ Tips for All Projects:

- Write a clean **README**: purpose, design, features, limitations.
    
- Include a brief **blog-style write-up** or project summary.
    
- Bonus: Add **demo screenshots** or videos for engagement.
