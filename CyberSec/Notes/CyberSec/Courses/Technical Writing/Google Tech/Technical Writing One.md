# Words
### Defining terms
- Learn to recognize possible unfamiliar words to your target audience 
	- If the term already exists, link to a good existing explanation
	- If the document introduces the term, define the term
- Allowed to introduce shortened notation for lengthy terms

### Use terms consistently
- Similar to changing the name of a variable midway through a function
	- Harder to follow

### Acronyms 
- On the initial use, spell out the full term and then put the acronym in parentheses
	- Use boldface for both acronym and spelled out version
- Don't cycle back and forth between acronym and full version (consistency)

**Guidelines**
- Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times
- Should be much shorter than original 
- Should appear many times in the doc


### Ambiguous Pronouns
Pronouns typically succeed a noun that it now fills in for
However this can cause confusion when used incorrectly.

In many cases it would be better to simply reuse the noun

**Guidelines**
- only use after introducing the noun
- place it near the noun, prefer repeating the noun instead of the pronoun
- if introducing another noun, reuse the noun instead of using a pronoun
