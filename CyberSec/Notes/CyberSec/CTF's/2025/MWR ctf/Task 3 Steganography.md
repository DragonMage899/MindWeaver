**Steganography** is a technique which involves hiding data within an ordinary, non-secret file or message to avoid detection. Steganography can be used to conceal any type of digital content, including text, image, video or audio content. Unlike **cryptography**, which focuses on making messages unreadable to unauthorized parties, steganography aims to hide _the existence of the message itself._ A non technical example of this would be a poem containing a message hidden in the first letter of every line.

Metadata is effectively "data that describes other data". The metadata information is not rendered with the content of the data and remains hidden to a user interacting with the resource. Metadata includes information relating to:
- The file creation data
- Author/Creator information
- Location coordinates
