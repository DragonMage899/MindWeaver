#### Context
Info email
Your internship will run from the redacted to the redacted, and you’ll be working with redacted. The week will be spent doing guided research, teaching you how to analyze vulnerabilities, write your own queries to discover them in a general, and writing exploit code. At the end of the week, you will be placed on a current project alongside our security consultants to repeat the process you learned.

You will have as much time as you would like for the remaining 4 weeks to spend investigating vulnerabilities, and submitting the output of your research. Our analysts will be availabe to you throughout this time to help or answer any questions you may have. You will be marked on the results you provide during this time.

Internship layout:
- Week 1: Guided vulnerability analysis with an expert and homework tasks
	- Log4j analysis and root cause analysis with a poc.
	- Joern tutorial and practical usage with log4j
	- Guided analysis of other cve's with help from the team
	- Homework task: 
		- Go over cve without guidance
		- Perform root cause analysis on the cve
		- Write a Joern query that identifies that specific vulnerability within the code base
- Week 2: Client work. Given a list of GHSA's related to packages with reach ability from various clients
	- Goal: 
		- Do a root cause analysis on the cve related to the ghsa
		- Write a joern query identifying the vulnerability
		- Use that query to validate that the reported vulnerable versions are correct.
	- Got through 5 packages 
- Week 3: 
	- Monday was the completion of the ghsa packages 
	- From Tuesday onwards
		- Given a list of python packages with GHSA's
		- Goal:
			- Inspect the github commit related to the GHSA
			- Provide the following for each commit: 
			- Is the commit related to the CVE in the GHSA? (yes/no)
			- Does the commit actually fix the issue or mitigate the vulnerability? (yes/no)
			- Give a reason why you stated the above
				- Perform a root cause analysis on the vulnerability and identify if the issue was fixed and if so why the fix was sufficient.
	- At the start of each day report on the packages we inspected to a team member, if and issues or note worthy things came up bring it up here.
- Weeks 4 and 5
	- Continues analysis of the python packages
	- team was there to help out if we ever got stuck
	- Daily stand ups in the morning reporting progress
	- 

#### Points I want in my feedback
- Some of the below are for context, only include key points.
Take the feedback with a grain of salt, based on my experience from running events. Feedback has also been helpful in helping us to improve to I always try to add feedback whenever I can. 
This may be unnecessary to include?

Information
- Initial email with the outline gave me a pretty good idea of what we were going to. I felt that I was adequately informed, maybe add information about the time of day we're expected to be available.
- If you do plan on allowing the option for remote next time, a heads up for the in office day before we start so we can properly plan and attend would be nice. The 3 weeks was a bit too soon to make arrangements and adjust my schedule, at least for me

Supervision and culture 
- The team were always available to help out at all times.
- They did a really good job of explaining and showcasing what we needed to do.
- Atmosphere felt open(maybe find a better work?), I think the general atmosphere was really great. (elaborate on this)
	- I felt welcomes and part of the team
	- Team members were always open to my questions and gave detailed responses.  
- Some individual feedback would be nice if possible, I'm not sure exactly what the feedback should be but something on how we could improve would be nice (feels a bit cheesy, find a better way to word this)

Learning 
- Got to learn a lot 
	- About how vulnerabilities actually occur out in there
	- Common vulnerability types in open source libraries 
	- Types of vulnerabilities and how to fix
	- How to properly research and analyse source code to get to the root of the problem
	- How to apply fixes to the issue and considerations to think of when fixing the code

Structure 
- More opportunity's to interact with the other interns co cooperatively , at least in the first week. Most of the work was done solo so I didn't really get a lot much time to interact with the other interns. 


Reflections
- Not quite sure what to add here just yet.

Closing
- Overall the experience was really great and something that I'm proud to have completed. 
- Would definitely recommend to upcoming students.  

Extra
- Enjoyed using joern and would like to continue using it, hope you don't mind me pestering you guys on slack when I do get to that.

Hey

I just wanted to say thanks again for the opportunity to be part of the internship program. Overall I had a really great time and appreciated the chance to learn, contribute and work alongside the team, It's something I'm genuinely proud to have completed.

I also wanted to give a bit of feedback based on my experience from the internship. 

The initial outline email gave me a clear sense of what to expect and did a good job covering the planned work. One small suggestion would be to include the expected working hours. Also, if remote participation is offered again, a bit more notice for the office shoot would help, three weeks was a bit tight for me personally.

The support from the team was excellent. Everyone was approachable and happy to help, I never felt like I couldn't ask questions and when I did I got clear and detailed responses which I do appreciate. The atmosphere was also really warm and welcoming which made it easy to feel part of the team from the start.   

The internship gave me a lot to learn and think about, from understanding how real world vulnerabilities happen, to how to identify, analyze, and fix them. The work we did throughout the internship period really helped to build my confidence when approaching more complex problems (queue flashback to commit with +300 -1000 lines of code with "remove code" as the description). 
I’d also love to continue exploring Joern in my own time, hope you don’t mind if I pop back into Slack for the occasional question xD

One thing that might be worth adding in future is a bit more structured time to collaborate with the other interns, perhaps during the first week. Most of our work ended up being pretty independent so having a bit more time to interact with each other would be nice. Also some small form of individual feedback on how we did and where we could improve post internship would be appreciated.

All in all, I really enjoyed the experience and would definitely recommend it to other students. Thanks again for making the internship such a valuable experience, especially for a first run. 

Kind regards,
Justin

Just finished up a really rewarding few weeks working with the team at [Whirly Labs (Pty) Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) as an intern. I got the chance to dive into real world vulnerabilities by analyzing and verifying reported issues, writing joern queries to find security flaws in code and contributing to security research alongside a talented team. The experience really helped to sharpen my understanding of vulnerability research and pushed me to take on tricky problems that taught me a lot along the way.

  

Huge thanks to the team for being so welcoming and supportive throughout, proud to have been part of it!
