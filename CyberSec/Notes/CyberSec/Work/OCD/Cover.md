Advent of Cyber 24. This comes to mind for a few reasons. It was an experience that really pushed me towards wanting to enter the security space. Before completing the room, I was still very much on the fence and only had a vague idea about what the working in the security space was actually like.
It also helps that the challenges were genuinely quite fun especially since each day had a unique challenge on a topic that I hadn't encountered before. Two challenges that stood out the most for me were the reverse engineering challenge, which always get's my ears perked up, and the Active Directory challenge. Despite using windows for over a decade at that point, and having broken it an ungodly amount of times, I thought I had a fairly decent understanding of the os, but the challenge lead me into rabbit holes that I didn't even know existed which made the experience all the more rewarding once I got to the end of it, after perhaps a few too many cups of coffee.

Thing

I'm always looking for opportunities to challenge and improve myself and the Academy is the perfect place to do just that. 

A little bit about me, I've been tinkering with tech for as long as I can remember. Some of my earliest memories include frantically trying to reinstall Windows before my brother got back home after downloading yet another virus, getting Linux running on my PS3 so I could backup copies of my games before they got scratched beyond repair and the excitement of finally seeing my first PC post after hours of building, rebuilding and troubleshooting. That curiosity of learning how things work (and how they break) naturally led me into the world of cybersecurity.

 Initially it was a passing interest, but the more I explored, diving into platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox and getting inspired by Darknet Diaries, Ghost in the Wires and the movie Hackers, the more hooked I became, until eventually I was a moth speeding into the flame. It feels like there's an endless wealth of cool things to learn and rabbit holes to get stuck in and that rush of having an idea click keeps me coming back again and again.

These days, you'll usually find me nose down in a book or puzzling my way through TryHackMe rooms and PicoGym challenges, where I'm tinkering with new tools or picking up soe new tricks, all the while being dosed with a healthy amount of impostor syndrome. I've also been diving head first into CTFs, both solo and with the HackSouth and Tuks teams, learningm just how much collaboration can turn a head scratcher into a light bulb moment. Earlier this year, I got a taste of real world security research during a internship. I dug into CVEs, analysing the root causes, verifying the effectiveness of the patch and experimenting with automating parts of vulnerability discovery using Joern, an unforgettable thrill that left me hungry for more

What draws me to the Academy is the people behind it. Every conversation I've had with a member of the OCD team has been both incredibly insightful and fun, whether that's discussing the mindset needed to be a great hacker, or the best way to make away with the money after robbing a bank, there's always been something to learn. The opportunity to be mentored and challenged by some of the best hackers in the country is something that get's me incredibly excited.  

Thanks for your time and for considering my application. I'm eager for the chance to bring my passion and curiosity to your team and learn from some of the best in the field.

Sincerely,
Justin

Cyber security pulled me in about a year ago when I started thinking about my future more seriously, and since then I‚Äôve been hooked. What started as late night dives into vulnerabilities, exploits and online labs has grown into a real passion, and I‚Äôm eager to learn from a team whose work I‚Äôve heard nothing but great things about and hopefully one day contribute to making the internet a safer place.
