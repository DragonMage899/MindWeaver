Focus on the generic requirements at a given layer.
Specific protocols are developed to address issues or solve a problem at that layer, in this fashion comprehension should be favored over memorization

Content discussed in practical's will be less emphasized in lectures (i.e doing the pracs won't help with learning the r=theory)

Content is densely packed into pages (more work than it seems)
