ambient: brightness is the same for all objects

BDFR given

kE - Color value'


use shadow ray to see if a surface receives light

- tells use whether to use lighting or shading
- The more light sources we have the more shadows we need thus more computation

Reflection can change the wave length of the light


ch5 - point light source on opaque surface

irradiance:
- Density of radiant power per unit area
doesn't care about surface only distance (box penetration)
tells us the box penetration of light


Lambers cosine law
- ...
- n.I tells us how closely aligned the light and surface are


Lambertian reflection vs Ideal
- understand when to use each

Lambertian - chalky reflection


Idea: half vector between light and viewing vector


Binn-Phong
Phong exponent to increase glossy loss
