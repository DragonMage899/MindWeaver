Hills and jumps innit

meta heuristic:
- Manages heuristics

Optimization problems
Two types

solutions can vary due to randomization
- does not mean its wrong


Single point search:
- Focus on single candidate solution

Hill climb
tabu
annealing
iterated local
variable neighborhood
....

Objective 
- trying to achieve

Fitness
- eval of sol at a particular state

Challenge of local optima
- can stop if heuristic is not good enough
Can use meta heuristics to address this
- Improve local optimum through re-optimization
- i.e. jumping from the top of a hill where there's no solution to some other point
- usually jump to some random point

- allows us to find better solutions vs local search
- to jump or not to jump, that is the question

Initial solution
- Random generation and heuristics
- Impacts result
