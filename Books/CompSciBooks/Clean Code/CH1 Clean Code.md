**Craftsmanship**
- Knowledge and Work
	- Principles, Patterns, Practices, Heuristics (approach to problem solving) -Knowledge
	- Grind knowledge into self with work

**Parts**
- Principles, Patterns and Practise of writing clean code
- Case Studies
- Payoff : List of heuristics and smells gathered

**Later Equals Never** 
- Write effective code from the get go (where plausible)

**Redesign of the sky**
- Tiger to team updates messy code whilst still maintaining updates
- Eventually the updated code becomes messy itself and warrants a redesign

**Attitude**
- Accept that your not a professional
- Defends the code and not the schedule

**Primal Conundrum**
- Deadlines warrant messy code (speed)
- but messy code slows you down in the long run
- Thus, keep the code clean at all times to maximise speed

Art of clean code
- If the only way to go fast is to write clean code, how do I write clean code?
- Clean code is like art, you can recognize good art from bad art, but that doesn't mean we know how to create the art
- Writing clean code is like creating art, you need a myriad of practised techniques

**Clean Code**
- Should be elegant, pleasing to read
- Should be efficient, to not temp "optimisation"
	- Bad code tempts the mess to grow
- Clean code does one thing well
	- Bad code tries to do too much
- Should be easy to enhance/change by non-author
- Code without tests is not clean
- Clean code is code that has been taken care of
- Clean code are so profoundly well written that you don't even notice it, The designer makes it look ridiculously simple ("that's what I expected")\
- It's our responsibility to make the language look simple (don't blame the language for not meeting your requirements)

Writing new code requires us to read old code
- Be a good author to make it easy and enjoyable to read
- 10:1 reading vs writing

**Boy Scout Rule**
- Code needs to be kept clean over time
- Active role in preventing degradation
***Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.***
- simple incremental changes over time is worth more than big individual uptakes
	- e.g) change a variable, break up functions into simple functions, eliminate duplication

**Conclusion**
- Books on art don't make you an artist
- They give you tools, techniques and thought processes that have artists have used
